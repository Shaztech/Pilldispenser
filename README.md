# Automated Pill Dispenser

Complete open source project with cheap and easily available parts (listing below).
All 3d printable parts are in STL format, Gerber PCB are packed in zip for easy drag-drop in 
your prefered provider (JCLPCB, PCBWay, etc).
Software are available pre-compiled (bin files) for the ESP32, or all Arduino files are there so you can 
edit them. I've included all the library I used. The full LCD interface is in Squareline Studio.
Just follow the guides in order to assemble it once you have all the parts.

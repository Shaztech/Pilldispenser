An Arduino IDE library for using Telegram Bot API. It's designed to be used with multiple Arduino architectures.

Join the [Arduino Telegram Library Group Chat](https://t.me/arduino_telegram_library) if you have any questions/feedback or would just like to be kept up to date with the library's progress.

## Help support what I do!

I have created a lot of different Arduino libraries that I hope people can make use of. [If you enjoy my work, please consider becoming a Github sponsor!](https://github.com/sponsors/witnessmenow/)

## Introduction

This library provides an interface for [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

Telegram is an instant messaging service that allows for the creation of bots. Bots can be configured to send and receive messages. This is useful for Arduino projects as you can receive updates from your project or issue it commands via your Telegram app from anywhere.

This is a library forked from [one library](https://github.com/Gianbacchio/ESP8266-TelegramBot) and inspired by [another](https://github.com/CasaJasmina/TelegramBot-Library)

Each library only supported a single type of Arduino and had different features implemented. The only thing that needs to be different for each board is the actual sending of requests to Telegram so I thought a library that additional architectures or boards could be configured easily would be useful, although this springs to mind:

## Installing

The downloaded code can be included as a new library into the IDE selecting the menu:

```
 Sketch / include Library / Add .Zip library
```

You also have to install the ArduinoJson library written by [Beno√Æt Blanchon](https://github.com/bblanchon). Search for it on the Arduino Library manager or get it from [here](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson).

## Getting Started

To generate your new Bot, you need an Access Token. Talk to [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and follow a few simple steps described [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).

Include UniversalTelegramBot in your project:

```ino
#include <UniversalTelegramBot.h>
```

and pass it a Bot token and a SSL Client (See the [examples](https://github.com/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot/tree/master/examples) for more details)

```ino
// Telegram BOT Token (Get from Botfather)
#define BOT_TOKEN "XXXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
WiFiClientSecure secured_client;
UniversalTelegramBot bot(BOT_TOKEN, secured_client);
```

## Features

Here is a list of features that this library covers. (Note: The examples link to the ESP8266 versions)

| _Receiving Messages_         | Your bot can read messages that are sent to it. This is useful for sending commands to your arduino such as toggle and LED                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `int getUpdates(long offset)` <br><br> Gets any pending messages from Telegram and stores them in **bot.messages** . Offset should be set to **bot.last_message_received** + 1. Returns the numbers new messages received.                                                                                   | [FlashLED](https://github.com/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot/blob/master/examples/ESP8266/FlashLED/FlashLED.ino) or any other example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| _Sending messages_           | Your bot can send messages to any Telegram or group. This can be useful to get the arduino to notify you of an event e.g. Button pressed etc (Note: bots can only message you if you messaged them first)                                                                                                                    | `bool sendMessage(String chat_id, String text, String parse_mode = "")` <br><br> Sends the message to the chat_id. Returns if the message sent or not.                                                                                                                                                       | [EchoBot](https://github.com/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot/blob/master/examples/ESP8266/EchoBot/EchoBot.ino#L51) or any other example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| _Send Photos_                | It is possible to send phtos from your bot. You can send images from the web or from the arduino directly (Only sending from an SD card has been tested, but it should be able to send from a camera module)                                                                                                                 | Check the examples for more info                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [From URL](https://github.com/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot/blob/master/examples/ESP8266/SendPhoto/PhotoFromURL/PhotoFromURL.ino)<br><br>[Binary from SD](https://github.com/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot/blob/master/examples/ESP8266/SendPhoto/PhotoFromSD/PhotoFromSD.ino)<br><br>[From File Id](https://github.com/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot/blob/master/examples/ESP8266/SendPhoto/PhotoFromFileID/PhotoFromFileID.ino) |
| _Chat Actions_               | Your bot can send chat actions, such as _typing_ or _sending photo_ to let the user know that the bot is doing something.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `bool sendChatAction(String chat_id, String chat_action)` <br><br> Send a the chat action to the specified chat_id.

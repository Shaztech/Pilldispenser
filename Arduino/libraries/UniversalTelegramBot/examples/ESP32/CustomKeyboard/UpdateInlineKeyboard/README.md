#ESP32 - LED button update

This is an example of how one can update inline keyboard messages (buttons).
The message_id of the specific message is sent when a message is received.
This message_id can be used to UPDATE that message.
One can update text inside a message, but also buttons can be updated.
This way one can build menu's, like the menu the botfather uses.

In this simple example we use a inlinekeyboard button to toggle (and update) the state of a LED.

NOTE: You will need to enter your SSID, password and bot Token for the example to work.

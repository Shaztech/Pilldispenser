### Async TCP Library for ESP32 Arduino

This is a fully asynchronous TCP library, aimed at enabling trouble-free, multi-connection network environment for Espressif's ESP32 MCUs.

This library is the base for [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/dvarrel/ESPAsyncWebServer)

The base classes on which everything else is built. They expose all possible scenarios, but are really raw and require more skills to use.
